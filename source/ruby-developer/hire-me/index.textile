If you're a company looking for a full-time Ruby or Javascript developer (and who isn't these days?), perhaps you'd like to hire us on an hourly basis, or "contract with us to work on your app *and train one of your developers at the same time*":/blog/2012/02/20/rails-recruitment-solution-hire-an-expert-to-train-an-employee-you-already-like/.
