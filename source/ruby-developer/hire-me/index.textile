h2(#rates). Rates

I charge $180 per hour and work on a monthly retainer basis.

h2(#availability). Availability

As of January, 2012, I'm accepting new contracts for 10-20 hours per week.

I can work remotely, in person in Philadelphia, or occasionally on-site in New York or Washington.

h2(#recruiters). Recruiters:

I'm flattered that you found me and want to get in touch about your hot new opportunity. Before you do though, please work the numbers and see that I won't be interested in a $115k job in San Francisco. That will save both of us considerable time. Thanks in advance.

If you're a company looking for a full-time Ruby developer (and who isn't these days?), perhaps you'd like to hire me on an hourly basis, or hire me to work on your app *and train a developer on Ruby at the same time*.
