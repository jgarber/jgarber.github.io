Please contact me for current availability.

I can work remotely, in person in Philadelphia, or occasionally on-site in New York or Washington.

h2(#recruiters). Recruiters:

If you're a company looking for a full-time Ruby developer (and who isn't these days?), perhaps you'd like to hire me on an hourly basis, or contract with me to work on your app *and train one of your developers at the same time*.
